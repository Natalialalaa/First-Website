        <h4>/ˈtæbjələ ˈrɑːsə/</h4>
        <p>Tabula rasa ("blank slate") is the theory that individuals are
            born without built-in mental content,
            and therefore all knowledge comes from experience or perception.
        </p>
            
        <h4>Pre-Wired?</h4>
        <p>In artificial intelligence, tabula rasa refers to the development of autonomous agents
            with a mechanism to reason and plan toward their goal, but no "built-in" knowledge-base
            of their environment. Thus, they truly are a blank slate.

            In reality, autonomous agents possess an initial data-set or knowledge-base, but this
            cannot be immutable or it would hamper autonomy and heuristic ability.
            if the data-set is empty, it usually may be argued that there is a built-in
            bias in the reasoning and planning mechanisms.<br>
            Either intentionally or unintentionally placed there by the human designer,
            it thus negates the true spirit of tabula rasa.

        <h4>Synthetic Language</h4>
        <p>LR(1), LALR(1) or SLR(1) Parsers could be considered a special case of a tabula rasa, 
            as it is designed to accept any of a possibly infinite set of source language programs,
            within a single programming language, and to output either a good parse of the program,
            or a good machine language translation of the program, either of which represents a success,
            or, alternately, a failure, and nothing else.<br>
            The "initial data-set" is a set of tables which are generally produced mechanically 
            by a parser table generator, usually from a BNF representation of the source language, 
            and represents a "table representation" of that single programming language.<br>

            AlphaZero achieved superhuman performance in various board games using self-play and tabula rasa 
            reinforcement learning, meaning it had no access <br>
            to hard-coded human knowledge, only being given the rules of the games.</p>
